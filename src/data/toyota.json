As we were commissioned to deliver a 15s interstitial, we wanted to captivate the younger audience and encourage them to interact with the ad. Through the use of vibrant colours and impressive 360 car animation, we achieved nearly 45% engagement rate, making it evident that our visual approach helped Toyota to reconnect with the targetted audience.",
